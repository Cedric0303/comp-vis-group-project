# Files and folders:

- `project.ipynb` - main program code
- `Dataset` - input image pair dataset
- `images` - program output images and plots

# Statistics and program outputs:

1. All images and plots used in the report are in `images` folder.
2. Each folder represents images and plots created by the program, with format `BLOCKSIZE_SEARCHSIZE` in the folder name.
3. For example, `25_50` folder contains images and plots created by using pixel block size of 25 and sliding window search size of 50.

# Instructions to run program:

1. Run each cell in `project.ipynb` sequentially to start the program.
2. Output images and statistic plots will be in `images` folder.
3. (optional) Change values of `BLOCK_SIZE` and `SEARCH_SIZE` to create output disparity maps of different pixel block size and sliding window search size.
